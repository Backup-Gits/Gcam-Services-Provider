# Gcam Services Provider

[![continuous](https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider/workflows/continuous/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider/actions)

This app "simulates" the Google Play Services that Gcam requires, allowing the camera app to be used on devices without Google Play Services. The app does not have a Ui for the simple reason that it is not needed.
